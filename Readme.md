For a weighted, connected, undirected graph, a Spanning Tree is a sub-graph that includes all the vertices of the original graph, and is also a tree.  A Minimum-Cost Spanning Tree is a spanning tree with the smallest sum of its edges’ costs.  Uses of Minimum-Cost Spanning Trees range from Taxonomy to Clustering analysis.
 
 In this assignment, you will implement Kruskal’s, Boruvka’s (Sollin’s) , and Prim’s algorithms to produce Minimum-Cost Spanning Trees from an undirected graph.
